    d_intro_h:"Introduction", d_intro_p1:"BagIdea Office is a living AI-agent office that runs as your desktop wallpaper. Every AI agent on your machine becomes a pixel-art employee in an HD-2D office: they walk to their desks when real work starts, gather at Security to ask permission, hold meetings, learn skills, and the lights follow your real local time.",
    d_intro_p2:"It is not a dashboard and not a chat window — it is a world that renders the true state of your Claude Code sessions, headless agent runs and custom scripts as living characters, behind your desktop icons.",
    d_intro_p3:"Three independent layers keep it robust: a zero-dependency Node daemon (the source of truth), a Godot 4 renderer (the wallpaper), and a lightweight overlay UI (chat, settings, approvals). The daemon keeps agents running even if rendering restarts.",

    d_what_h:"What it is", d_what_p:"At its heart, BagIdea Office is an operations layer for AI agents — given a place, a society, and room to grow. Inspired by openclaw (the agent-office idea) and Hermes (agents that learn skills on their own), it goes further: with your permission the agents really build projects and even propose and write their own plugins. Instead of a flat list of tasks, you get a spatial, honest view of what your agents are actually doing:",
    d_what_l1:"Real Claude Code sessions, spawned with each agent's persona, skills and allowed tools.",
    d_what_l2:"A CEO → Director → team chain of command you drive by giving orders.",
    d_what_l3:"Spatialized permission approvals — agents walk to Security for tools you haven't granted.",
    d_what_l4:"Real project folders, resumable sessions, and self-splitting sub-agents for parallel work.",

    d_concepts_h:"Core concepts",
    d_c_ceo_h:"You are the CEO", d_c_ceo_p:"The gold seat is you. Type an order and the Director (the main Claude agent) walks over, takes it, plans, and delegates to the team.",
    d_c_director_h:"The Director", d_c_director_p:"main is your second-in-command — Shino by default: a playful-but-focused manager who answers you, creates projects, and routes work to the team with DELEGATE lines. Tuned for delegation over hands-on work; you can re-tune or rename him in the editor.",
    d_c_ghost_h:"Ghosts (sub-agents)", d_c_ghost_p:"When a job parallelizes, an agent splits into translucent clones that work on the Ghost Deck and merge back with a synthesis.",
    d_c_grid_h:"The room grid", d_c_grid_p:"The floor is a 3×3 jigsaw of identical rooms; any room fits any slot, so you can rearrange the whole office in the editor.",

    d_install_h:"Installation",
    d_install_win_h:"Windows — one-shot installer (recommended)",
    d_install_win_p:"Open PowerShell and run the command below. On a bare machine it installs everything needed — Git, Node LTS, Rust, the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (the Rust linker, and the most common reason a build fails), Godot 4.6.3 and the Claude Code CLI — then clones the app to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\BagIdeaOffice, builds the desktop shell, brands the window icon, adds bagidea to your PATH and creates a Start Menu shortcut. Freshly installed tools are pulled onto the current PATH so it finishes in one pass, and it is safe to re-run (a re-run does a git pull; your data is kept). The first run downloads the C++ Build Tools (~2–4 GB, one time) if they are missing.",
    d_install_fix_h:"If the install fails",
    d_install_fix_p:"The installer is built to finish on a bare machine, but here are the common snags and their fixes. Almost all are solved by opening a NEW terminal and re-running the installer — re-runs are safe and keep your data.",

Run <code>winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override \"--quiet --wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended\"</code> (or add \"Desktop development with C++\" in the Visual Studio Installer), open a new terminal, re-run.",
    d_install_fix_l4:"<b>git / node / cargo not found right after install</b> — winget updates PATH in the registry, not the open shell. Open a new terminal and re-run; it finishes from where it stopped.",
    d_install_fix_l5:"<b>SmartScreen / Defender blocks the script</b> — it's open source (read it in the repo). Choose \"More info → Run anyway\", or download install.ps1 and run it yourself.",
    d_install_fix_l6:"<b>bagidea command not found after a successful build</b> — it was just added to PATH; open a new terminal, or launch from Start Menu → \"BagIdea Office\".",
    d_install_manual_h:"Manual build",

    d_install_first_h:"First run",
    d_install_first_p:"Log in to Claude once, then start the office. Your wallpaper becomes the live office; a chat head and tray icon appear.",
    d_install_plat:"Platform support: Windows 11 (stable, wallpaper embedding uses the WorkerW technique) and macOS 13+ (beta, new this release). A Linux backend is planned for a later update.",

    d_using_h:"Using it",
    d_chat_h:"Chat & the CEO", d_chat_p:"The chat panel opens on your CEO seat. Type an order in the CEO seat and the Director walks over to take it, plans, and delegates — you watch the hand-offs on the wallpaper, and the summary is walked back to you. To talk to any agent directly, click their face in the rail or on the live map. Every conversation is a resumable thread with full history.",
    d_projects_h:"Projects", d_projects_p:"Register real folders as projects (with PLACE shorthands like \"classroom → D:\\Learning\"). The Director can create new projects himself and route work into them; the assignee's Claude session runs inside that directory and is resumable. One occupant at a time: while an agent works a project you can't open it (a ⏹ stop-agent button with a two-click confirm lets you take over), and while you have it open an agent won't enter.",
    d_org_p:"The whole roster arranges itself into an org chart (🗂 → ORG): CEO → Director → mid → staff. Hire from ⚙ → AGENTS: name, role, avatar + aura, tier, a Persona Copilot that fills the prompt and picks fitting skills + tools, one of 16 voices, and the exact tools each agent may run.",
    d_security_h:"Permissions", d_security_p:"Tools you grant in an agent's profile run silently — and the agent never even leaves its desk. For anything else, the agent walks to the Security Center and waits while a card pops up with the exact command. Choose Allow, ✓✓ Forever (remembers the grant), or Deny. No answer in 50 seconds auto-denies and the agent re-plans.",
    d_editor_h:"The 3D Editor", d_editor_p:"Open the editor (the 🎨 button or bagidea editor) to rearrange the office in true 3D: click two rooms to swap them on the 3×3 grid, move the Ghost Deck, place furniture and decor, and import your own .glb/.gltf/.fbx models and images. Save and the wallpaper updates instantly — furniture, agent seats, navigation and pets all follow.",
    d_voice_h:"Voice & channels", d_voice_p:"Hold F6 anywhere to speak a command to the office. Give agents one of 16 TTS voices (split clearly ♀/♂) — the ▶ preview introduces itself by the right gender and the office language. Voiced agents speak short lines on their own for flavour (long read-aloud only when you ask). Call the main agent for a realtime voice conversation (Gemini Live) in its assigned voice. Connect Telegram, Discord or LINE and command your office from your phone — replies come back on the same channel. Voice features need a Gemini key and switch off cleanly when one isn't set.",
    d_updates_h:"Updates & start-up", d_updates_p:"A VERSION file marks real releases: the office only shows the 🔄 update banner when main's version is newer than yours, so routine commits never nag you. Click the banner or run bagidea update to pull, rebuild and relaunch (your data is kept). Set it to launch with Windows from the tray, settings, or bagidea startup on.",

    d_plugins_h:"Plugins, skills & tools",
    d_plugins_p:"Plugins extend the office for real — a folder with a manifest can add UI panels, HTTP routes, and commands agents can drive, with ctx access to the registry, feed, broadcasting and even running Claude turns. Two core plugins ship in the box (🎵 Music Player, 🧮 Calculator); install more from any GitHub repo. Start from the official template, or read the worked example repos.",
    d_skills_p:"Every office ships with a library of builtin skills (office operations, deep research, office control, plugin building, code review, docs, debugging, data wrangling, project kickoff, diagrams) you can assign to any agent, plus Hermes-style skills the office learns automatically after real work. Add new raw capability via MCP servers.",
    d_lang_h:"Languages", d_lang_p:"The whole interface supports 14 languages. English is the default; pick another in settings and the office translates office-wide (and remembers your choice per machine). This website speaks the same 14 languages — use the picker in the top bar.",

    d_cli_h:"CLI reference", d_cli_p:"The installer puts bagidea on your PATH. It talks to the running office and can start it. A few highlights:",
    d_faq_h:"FAQ",
    d_faq_q1:"Does it cost money to run?", d_faq_a1:"The app is free and open source (MIT). Agents run through your own Claude Code login, so usage follows your existing Claude account or subscription — there is no separate BagIdea fee.",
    d_faq_q2:"Is my code/data sent anywhere?", d_faq_a2:"The daemon runs locally on 127.0.0.1. Agents are Claude Code sessions, so they use Claude like any Claude Code project. Optional features (voice, image, realtime) use your own OpenAI/Gemini keys only when you enable them.",
    d_faq_q3:"Which platforms are supported?", d_faq_a3:"Windows 11 and macOS 13+ (beta) today. A Linux wallpaper backend is on the roadmap.",
    d_faq_q4:"Can I build my own plugin?", d_faq_a4:"Yes — fork the official template repo. A person or an agent can build a working plugin from it in minutes; the full spec is in the plugin guide.",

    d_intro_h:"Einführung", d_intro_p1:"BagIdea Office ist ein lebendiges KI-Agenten-Büro, das als dein Desktop-Hintergrund läuft. Jeder KI-Agent auf deinem Rechner wird zu einem Pixel-Art-Mitarbeiter in einem HD-2D-Büro: Sie gehen an ihre Schreibtische, wenn die echte Arbeit beginnt, versammeln sich an der Security, um um Erlaubnis zu bitten, halten Meetings ab, erlernen Fähigkeiten, und das Licht folgt deiner realen Ortszeit.",
    d_intro_p2:"Es ist kein Dashboard und kein Chatfenster — es ist eine Welt, die den wahren Zustand Ihrer Claude Code-Sitzungen, kopflosen Agent-Läufe und benutzerdefinierten Skripte als lebendige Figuren hinter Ihren Desktop-Icons rendert.",
    d_intro_p3:"Drei unabhängige Schichten sorgen für Robustheit: ein abhängigkeitsfreier Node-Daemon (die einzige Wahrheitsquelle), ein Godot 4-Renderer (das Hintergrundbild) und eine leichtgewichtige Overlay-UI (Chat, Einstellungen, Genehmigungen). Der Daemon hält Agents am Laufen, auch wenn der Renderer neu startet.",

    d_what_h:"Was es ist", d_what_p:"Im Kern ist BagIdea Office eine Betriebsschicht für KI-Agents — mit einem Ort versehen. Anstatt einer flachen Aufgabenliste erhalten Sie eine räumliche, ehrliche Ansicht dessen, was Ihre Agents tatsächlich tun:",
    d_what_l1:"Echte Claude Code-Sitzungen, erzeugt mit der Persona, den Fähigkeiten und erlaubten Werkzeugen jedes Agents.",
    d_what_l2:"Eine CEO → Director → Team-Befehlskette, die Sie durch das Geben von Befehlen steuern.",

Es ist sicher, es erneut auszuführen — jeder Schritt überspringt, was bereits erledigt ist.",

    d_chat_h:"Chat & CEO", d_chat_p:"Das Chat-Panel öffnet sich auf Ihrem CEO-Sitz. Geben Sie einen Befehl auf dem CEO-Sitz ein und der Director kommt herüber, um ihn entgegenzunehmen, plant und delegiert — Sie sehen die Übergaben auf dem Hintergrundbild, und die Zusammenfassung wird zu Ihnen zurückgebracht. Um direkt mit einem Agent zu sprechen, klicken Sie auf sein Gesicht in der Leiste oder auf der Live-Karte. Jedes Gespräch ist ein fortsetzbarer Thread mit vollständigem Verlauf.",
    d_projects_h:"Projekte", d_projects_p:"Registrieren Sie echte Ordner als Projekte (mit PLACE-Kürzeln wie \"Klassenzimmer → D:\\Learning\"). Der Director kann selbst neue Projekte erstellen und Arbeit dorthin weiterleiten; die Claude-Sitzung des Aufgabennehmers läuft in diesem Verzeichnis und ist fortsetzbar. Ein Fenster pro Projekt — ▶ öffnet es oder zeigt eine Live-Ansicht, während ein Agent arbeitet.",
    d_security_h:"Berechtigungen", d_security_p:"Werkzeuge, die Sie im Profil eines Agents freigeben, laufen lautlos — und der Agent verlässt sogar seinen Schreibtisch nie. Für alles andere geht der Agent zur Sicherheitszentrale und wartet, während eine Karte mit dem genauen Befehl erscheint. Wählen Sie Erlauben, ✓✓ Immer (merkt sich die Genehmigung) oder Ablehnen. Keine Antwort in 50 Sekunden lehnt automatisch ab und der Agent plant neu.",
    d_editor_h:"Der 3D-Editor", d_editor_p:"Öffnen Sie den Editor (die 🎨-Schaltfläche oder bagidea editor), um das Büro in echtem 3D umzuordnen: Klicken Sie zwei Räume an, um sie auf dem 3×3-Raster zu tauschen, verschieben Sie das Ghost Deck, platzieren Sie Möbel und Dekoration und importieren Sie eigene .glb/.gltf/.fbx-Modelle und Bilder. Speichern Sie und das Hintergrundbild wird sofort aktualisiert — Möbel, Agent-Plätze, Navigation und Haustiere folgen alle.",

Verbinden Sie Telegram, Discord oder LINE und steuern Sie Ihr Büro von Ihrem Telefon aus — Antworten kommen auf demselben Kanal zurück.",

Zwei Kern-Plugins werden mitgeliefert (🎵 Music Player, 🧮 Calculator); installieren Sie weitere aus jedem GitHub-Repo. Starten Sie mit der offiziellen Vorlage oder lesen Sie die Beispiel-Repos.",
    d_skills_p:"Jedes Büro wird mit einer Bibliothek integrierter Fähigkeiten geliefert (Tiefenrecherche, Bürosteuerung, Plugin-Erstellung, Code-Review, Dokumentation, Debugging, Datenverwaltung, Projekt-Kickoff, Diagramme), die Sie jedem Agent zuweisen können, plus Hermes-artige Fähigkeiten, die das Büro nach echter Arbeit automatisch erlernt. Fügen Sie neue rohe Fähigkeiten über MCP-Server hinzu.",
    d_lang_h:"Sprachen", d_lang_p:"Die gesamte Oberfläche unterstützt 14 Sprachen. Englisch ist die Standardsprache; wählen Sie eine andere in den Einstellungen und das Büro übersetzt büroweit (und merkt sich Ihre Wahl pro Rechner).

    d_faq_q2:"Werden mein Code/meine Daten irgendwohin gesendet?", d_faq_a2:"Der Daemon läuft lokal auf 127.0.0.1. Agents sind Claude Code-Sitzungen, daher verwenden sie Claude wie jedes Claude Code-Projekt. Optionale Funktionen (Sprache, Bild, Echtzeit) verwenden nur Ihre eigenen OpenAI/Gemini-Schlüssel, wenn Sie sie aktivieren.",
    d_faq_q3:"Welche Plattformen werden unterstützt?", d_faq_a3:"Windows 11 und macOS 13+ (beta) heute. Ein Linux-Hintergrundbild-Backend steht auf der Roadmap.",
    d_faq_q4:"Kann ich mein eigenes Plugin bauen?", d_faq_a4:"Ja — forken Sie das offizielle Vorlagen-Repo. Eine Person oder ein Agent kann in Minuten ein funktionierendes Plugin daraus erstellen; die vollständige Spezifikation befindet sich im Plugin-Leitfaden.",
